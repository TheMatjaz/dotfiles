  default text editors and so on

### Installer/automation scripts

Those scripts are meant to be portable, so they react differently based on the
operative system. Currently are implemented for OS X and Linux Debian/Ubuntu.

- [`matjaz_dotfiles_installer.sh`](matjaz_dotfiles_installer.sh) installs _Oh My
  ZSH!_, if not already installed, clones this dotfiles repository and creates
  symlinks in the home directory to the just git-cloned dotfiles configuration
  files.
- [`new_system_packages_installer.sh`](new_system_packages_installer.sh) which
  installs some basic packages from the main package manager of the current
  operating system. Currently only for `brew` + `brew cask` or `apt-get` and
  `pip3` installed, and a bunch of basic useful formulas.
- [`full_system_updater.sh`](full_system_updater.sh) just like
  `new_system_packages_installs.sh` detects the operative system and updates
  all the packages of its package managers: currently only for `brew` + `brew
  cask` or `apt-get`, `pip3` and `gem`.


Installation
------------

All you need to do is download and run the
[`matjaz_dotfiles_installer.sh`](matjaz_dotfiles_installer.sh) which should
handle all the rest. It installs the dotfiles repository in
`~/Development/Dotfiles`. Change that setting in the file, if needed.

Run the following command to perform the whole job:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/TheMatjaz/dotfiles/master/matjaz_dotfiles_installer.sh -O -)"
```

After that I suggest running the
[`new_system_packages_installer.sh`](new_system_packages_installer.sh), which is
located in the dotfiles repository (default in `~/Development/Dotfiles`),
especially on freshly installed systems:

```bash
bash new_system_packages_installer.sh
```

It ask for root password just for `gem` updates.
